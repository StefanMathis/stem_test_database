stem_test_database
==================

This repository contains an example database for materials and motors from the
[stem](https://stefanmathis.github.io/stem_book/) simulation toolbox for
electric motors. It is usually included as a submodule in other crates of the
framework to provide materials and motors for unit and integration tests.
